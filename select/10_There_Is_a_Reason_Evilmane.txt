I got a lot up on my mind
And i dont know what to do
All this weight up on my shoulder
But you know im pushin through
Livin in this fuckin zoo
Aint nobody got a clue
So i sit alone at night
Im starin at the fuckin moon
What is consciousness
I promise you there is a reason
The walks of life
Complexity of all
The pretty seasons
Just get a taste of nature
Releasing all that fuckin anger
This world is shifting
To another age
Its feelin faker
Wake up in the morning
Just anotha fuckin day
My head is my racing
Comtemplating
While im here to stay
I cannot seem to stop focusin
In up in the hate
Dont take this for granted
Face your demons
Do not walk away
Get the fuck up
Bring the mothafuckin pain
Ill slap any bitch who comes up in the mothafuckin way
Im breakin all these chains hoe
Im crackin all these lames hoe
Its evilmane you stupid hoe
Im livin with the deadly crows
There is more to what you seein with ya two front eyes
Authority i do despise
I see right thru the lies
My experience has told me otherwise
I traveled through these realms
I came onto the otha side
I thought i fuckin died
Disintegrated as a human being
I hit the ceiling
Im not seeing im just being
You will know the feeling
When it happens everything
Will fold into yo soul
These spirits guide you further
With the help they take ahold
Its an overload
This download is not movin slow
I cannot seem to find my folders
Mane i do not know
Im pouring tears up out my eyes cus its so beautiful
We need to take a minute
Go look
Appreciate our home
We dont have as much control
As wed like to see it
All i see is damaged souls
The same air
Yeah we breath it
Society confined by crooked government officials
The populations always losing
So just shoot a misssssleeee
One day we will all become
Apart of the dirt
So chase ya mothafuckin dreams
And know ya fuckin worth
We have a contract
With the reaper
He will choose ya time
Up on this earth
The truth hurts
You gotta be in first
So im out here hustling
Im doing what i want
I never bow down to the system
Fuck ya fuckin job
I cannot work a nine to five
Mane that shit is not for me
I gotta live on my own time
So i can breath & feel free
Mane a war is coming mothafucka
Buckle up
I stand beside my family
Homie i will knuckle up
Loyalty is what i bleed
If you standing next to me
Just know that you apart of me
And you are all that i need
